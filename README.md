# shipsDubelApp
Demo app to show marine data

Source code for the demo app deployed on AWS here: http://3.16.218.218:3838/shipsDubelApp/ (or just use alias http://datavalue.pl)

NOTE: app from here won't work alone as it requires additional file *data/ships_organised.csv* that is modified with script *R/prepare-data.R* file *ships.csv* that can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/160JnqoQysqzvR1GBBnKJFKAew_v6TYli
